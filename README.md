A javascript that will take all the people you follow on Medium.com and convert it to an OPML file. 

1. Go to your Medium profile in a Chrome browser on desktop (not mobile, please).
2. On the right side of your Medium profile is a list of people you follow. Click "See all".
3. Scroll, scroll, scroll down to the bottom of the page. It is very important that you keep scrolling because the page doesn't initially load all the people you follow.
